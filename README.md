A prototype coffee tracker built with a React front end and a Django Rest Framework backend. Coffees can be added to a user's list or favourites by browsing or with a separate url path designed for QR codes. A map and details page allows users to see details such as origin, process, roaster etc allowing a connectiong between consumption and source.
